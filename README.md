## Note
Since technical assignments demands were to fetch a list of data and to deploy the website into 
So i decided to use Next.js ( which is an open-source development framework built on top of Node.js enabling React based web applications functionalities such as server side rendering and generating static websites) for it as it makes fetching api's very easier and we dont have to use external library like axios and hooks like use state
next also has integration with vercel which will make deployment alot easier.

## Libraries:
 * __Framer Motion__: It was used to add minimal motion based animations to make it visually appealing
 * __SCSS__: This is a pre-processor for CSS ( it makes CSS easier and more readable)
